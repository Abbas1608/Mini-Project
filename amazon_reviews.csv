1,"The sound quality is best in this range and I literally mean it. Battery life is also good. After using it for an year it still give best performance just like in the beginning.

There are some few cons about it like the slight delay of sound in gaming for instance when sound of foots in bgmi and free fire.
The cushion quality is good but it will eventually tear somehow if you didn't took good care of it like not wearing it while wearing a cap winter caps. One more thing use delicately while rotating it. If need for gaming I don't recommend but if its music and cinema it's the best you can have. and yes its value for money. Your ears won't have pain even after a longtime use."

3,"I've been using the Hammer Blash Max headphones for a month, and they’re honestly a hidden gem. The sound quality is absolutely incredible – rich, deep, and crystal clear. The mic performs great, making calls smooth, and the sound isolation helps me stay focused on my studies. As a student, it's a perfect choice, especially when compared to brands like Noise or BoAt in the same price range. The premium feel of these headphones really stands out.

What really sets the Blash Max apart is the design. The 180-degree rotation ensures they stay safe from damage when not in use, unlike other headsets that can break or tilt. The soft cushions and matte finish make long online classes and study sessions comfortable. Plus, they're ideal for outdoor activities, traveling, and gym workouts – they won’t fall off like buds, which is a huge bonus. Covering the full ear, they provide a much better experience than typical on-ear headphones.

The build quality is fantastic, and the customer support team is quick and responsive if you ever need assistance. The only slight drawback is the charging time, but once charged, the call quality is premium and clear, and the music is immersive. What really impressed me is the touch controls – something you rarely find in other brands at this price. If you're looking for a durable, stylish, and functional headset, the Hammer Blash Max is the way to go!"
4,"These headphones are good value for money.
Sound wise, they are tuned for essentially vocal heavy music. Do not expect anything too good at this price point in a headphone. Music sounds like it's coming from a hollow space. Not recommended for EDM, Rock, Thrash Metal or anything with too much sub-bass and bass.
As far as the fit goes, that's my biggest complaint. It feels like it doesn't cover your ears properly ever. And turning your head makes the cups lift slightly from the ear. It mat feel a little tight initially.
The touch controls on the headphone are bad. It's is very difficult to accurately control the volume and track seeking with the touch. It either senses your touch properly, or simply doesn't.
Mic quality is decent.
Weight wise, the weigh around 600-650 gms. Not heavy.
The appearance of the headphone is very good."

7,"Been using the Hammer BashMax headphones for a while now, and they’re impressive! The sound quality is crisp, with deep bass and clear highs, making them perfect for music and gaming. The comfortable fit ensures long listening sessions without discomfort. Plus, the battery life is solid, lasting hours on a single charge. Definitely a great value for the price!"
8,"These headphones have nice quality in terms of comfort , but they are too tight. My head is average sized and when I tried to put it on one with a slight bending and it just broke. I tried to fix it with fewikwick and such it broke again after few weeks . And a day ago my friend who has a bigger head than me put it on without knowing not to bend it , it broke again."
